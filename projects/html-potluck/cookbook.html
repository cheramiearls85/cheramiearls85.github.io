          <i class="fa-solid fa-heart-pulse" style="color: #d9350d;"></i>
          <img src="images/apple-crisp.jpg">
          <h2>Ingredients</h2>
          <h3>For The Topping:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>⅓ cup (38g) whole wheat pastry</li>
            <li>
                flour (or regular flour or gluten free oat flour or 
                almond flour)
            </li>
            <li>
                ½ cup (48g) old fashioned rolled oats, gluten free if desired.
            </li>
            <li>
                ⅓ cup (71g) dark brown sugar 
                (can also sub coconut sugar but brown sugar is best)
            </li>
            <li>½ cup (56g) raw chopped pecans</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon cinnamon</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>
                ¼ cup (57g) cold butter or vegan buttery stick, cut into 
                very small cubes (can also use coconut oil)
            </li>
        </ul>
            
         <h3>For The Crisp:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                5-6 medium Honeycrisp or Granny Smith apples, peeled, 
                cored and very thinly sliced
            </li>
            <li>⅓ cup (104g) pure maple syrup</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon cinnamon</li>
            <li>pinch of nutmeg</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon bourbon (or pure vanilla extract)</li>
         </ul>
         <hr>
         <ol>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Generously grease an 8x8 
                baking pan with nonstick cooking spray. Set aside.
            </li>
            <li>
                To make the topping: Combine the flour, oats, brown sugar, 
                cinnamon, salt and pecans in a large bowl until well-combined. 
                Add in the pieces of butter and use your hands to squeeze and 
                combine until the mixture becomes crumbly and resembles wet 
                sand. (Alternatively, you can cut in the butter with a pastry 
                cutter, or place all of the topping ingredients in a food 
                processor and pulse until just blended. My favorite method is 
                to use my hands, as I believe you get the best crumbly topping 
                that way.)
            </li>
            <li>Once finished, place topping in the fridge and 
                begin making the apple filling.
            </li>
            <li>To make the filling: Place apples, maple syrup, cinnamon, 
                nutmeg and bourbon (or vanilla) in a large bowl and toss to 
                combine. Allow to sit for 5-10 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Take 1/3 cup of the topping mixture and toss with the 
                apple mixture. Place the apple mixture in prepared 
                pan and sprinkle evenly with topping.
            </li>
            <li>Bake the crisp on a baking sheet (just in case the filling 
                bubbles over!) for 45-55 minutes, or until topping is 
                golden brown and filling is bubbling. Remove from oven and 
                cool 10 minutes on wire rack. Serve warm with your favorite 
                vanilla ice cream. Makes 9 servings.
            </li>

            <li>4 ½ cups chicken broth</li>
            <li>1 chicken bouillon cube, optional</li>
            <li>1 ½ cups half and half</li>
            <li>¾ cup frozen peas</li>
        </ul>
        <H3>Seasonings</H3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
            <li>
                ½ teaspoon EACH: dried basil, parsley, thyme, rosemary, 
                mustard powder
            </li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground sage</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Dumplings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups cake flour, or all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
            <li>¾ cup cold sour cream</li>
            <li>¼ cup cold milk</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Instructions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Sear the chicken</li>
                <p>
                     (Searing the chicken is optional, raw or cooked chicken 
                     can be added right to the broth in later steps. 
                     Searing first adds a lot of flavor to the soup pot which 
                     makes the broth more flavorful. It also adds color and 
                     texture to some of the chicken.)
                </p>
            <li>Season each side of the chicken with salt and pepper.</li>
                <p>
                    Heat olive oil in a 4 ½-quart soup pot over medium-high 
                    heat.
                </p>
            <li>Add the chicken</li>
                <p>
                    cook for 3 minutes per side, until a little bit of a 
                    brown color has developed. The middle will still be 
                    uncooked. Let the chicken rest for 10 minutes, then 
                    cut into bite-sized pieces. (Discard the bones.)
                </p>
        <h3>Make the soup</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Combine the seasonings</b></li>
                <p>set aside.</p>
            <li><b>Melt the butter</b></li>
                <p>
                    in the same pot over medium heat and use a silicone spatula
                     to “clean” the bottom of the pot. Add the diced onions, 
                     carrots, and celery and cook for 5 minutes. Add the minced 
                     garlic, Worcestershire sauce, hot sauce, and seasonings. 
                     Cook for 1 more minute.
                </p>
            <li><b>Add the flour</b></li>
                <p>
                    and toss to coat. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring continuously.
                </p>
            <li><b>Add the chicken broth</b></li>
                <p>
                    in small splashes, stirring continuously. Scrape up any 
                    remnants from the bottom of the pot as you do so. Add the 
                    half and half in the same manner. Add the chicken 
                    bouillon, if using.
                </p>
            <li><b>Add frozen peas.</b></li>
                <p>Bring to a gentle boil and let it simmer, uncovered, 
                    while you make the dumplings.
                </p>
        </ol>
        <h3>Make the Dumpling</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><b>Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, 
                garlic powder, and sugar</b></li>
                <p>in a medium bowl.</p>
            <li><b>Add the milk, sour cream, and melted butter.</b></li>
                <p>
                    Use a folding motion to combine and form a dough, but don’t 
                    overmix or they will be dense.
                </p>
            <li><b>Add the chicken</b></li>
                <p> back to the soup along with any juices from the plate. Stir 
                    to combine and reduce heat to low. 
                    (If using leftover chicken, add it now.)
                </p>
            <li>
                Use a small cookie scoop and carefully place the dumplings over 
                the soup in an even layer. Spoon a little liquid over each one.
            </li>
            <li>Cover tightly and increase heat slightly to bring it to a 
                gentle simmer. Set a timer for 15 minutes, don’t lift the lid
             during this time, the dumplings need to steam.
            </li>
            <li>Open the lid and insert a toothpick into the middle of a 
                dumpling to check for doneness. If it comes out clean, it’s 
                ready. If not, cover and simmer for a few more minutes.
            <li>Once the middle is set, garnish with parsley and serve!</li>

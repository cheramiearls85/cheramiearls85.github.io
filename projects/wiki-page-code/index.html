        <p><b>Crown Shyness</b> (also canopy disengagement,<sup>[1]</sup>
             canopy shyness,<sup>[2]</sup> or inter-crown spacing<sup>[3]</sup>)
             is a phenomenon observed in some tree species, in which the crowns 
             of fully stocked trees do not touch each other, forming a canopy 
             with channel-like gaps.<sup>[4][5]</sup> The phenomenon is most 
             prevalent among trees of the same species, but also occurs between 
             trees of different species.<sup>[6][7]</sup> There exist many hypotheses as 
             to why crown shyness is an adaptive behavior, and research 
             suggests that it might inhibit spread of leaf-eating insect 
             larvae.<sup>[8]</sup>

            If we remove all consequences, We raise children who <b>struggle</b>
            with authority, responsibility, and self regulation.
            If we rely on punishment, we raise children who comply out of fear,
            not understanding.
        </p>

            Maybe thr real question is this: Are we teaching self-discipline or
            are we reacting to misbehavior? The goal to discipline is not 
            control. It is character formation.

            <li>clear boundaries</li>
            <li>consistent consequences</li>
            <li>emotional safety</li>
            <li>respect for authority</li>
